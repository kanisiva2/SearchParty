SearchParty is a React Native mobile application built with Expo that facilitates group coordination through real-time communication and interactive mapping features like heatmaps. The app leverages Firebase for secure user authentication and data management, while using Expo Router for seamless navigation and react-native-maps for location services. To get started, users should clone the repository, install dependencies via npm install, and configure the firebaseConfig.ts file with their credentials before running npx expo start to launch the app on a device or emulator.
